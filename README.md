Homebridge-LMS for Homebridge V2.

This plugin enables HomeBridge to connect Lyrion Media Servers endpoints to HomeKit for control via Siri or inclusion in an automation. 
Endpoints, e.g. PiCorePlayer speakers, appear as a fan within Homebridge and Apple Home.  
The fan turns on and off for play and pause. The fan speed controls the volume. 0 is mute, 100 is full volume. This plugin should detect your endpoints (e.g. your attached PiCorePlayer speaker). 

This is still fairly early days for the plugin. I am not really a programmer, I'm more of someone interested in getting things to work and knows how to write a prompt for ChatGPT. 
Eventually, I intend this plugin to auto-detect your Lyrion Media Server and just work.

This is for my personal use.
